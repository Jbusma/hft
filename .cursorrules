# HFT Project Development Rules

## Build & Test Workflow

1. Always rebuild after changes:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run tests (two options)
ctest --output-on-failure  # Preferred for detailed output
# OR
./tests/hft-tests         # Direct test execution
```

## Code Organization

1. Template implementations go in header files (.hpp), not source files (.cpp)
2. Source files (.cpp) for templates should only include their headers
3. Use include guards (#pragma once) in all headers

## Testing Guidelines

1. Build tests before running:
```bash
cd build
make hft-tests
```

2. Run specific test suites:
```bash
./tests/hft-tests --run_test=OrderBookTests
./tests/hft-tests --run_test=MatchingEngineTests
```

3. Get detailed test output:
```bash
./tests/hft-tests --log_level=all
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. Template class implementations must be in headers
2. Remember to include Utils.hpp when using utils namespace
3. Be careful with map comparisons and ternary operators
4. Check build directory location when running executables

## Directory Structure

```
hft-trading-system/
├── include/          # All headers (.hpp)
├── src/             # Source files (.cpp)
├── tests/           # Test files
└── build/           # Build artifacts (not in git)
```

## Build System

1. CMake version 3.15 or higher required
2. Dependencies:
   - Boost
   - TBB
   - Google Benchmark

## Development Flow

1. Make changes
2. Clean build
3. Run tests
4. Run benchmarks
5. Commit if all tests pass
